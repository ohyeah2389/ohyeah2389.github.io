## Who I Am
My name is Aaron. My online handle is ohyeah2389. I'm a semi-professional digital environment modeler and programmer. I'm primarily interested in racing and flight simulators for both recreational and commercial use.

## What I Do
I specialize in creating high-fidelity 3D environments and vehicles for racing and flight simulators. As a freelance modeler, I work primarily with individual sim racing enthusiasts and racing facilities looking to digitize their tracks for on-site simulators.

My expertise centers on **automotive and karting racetracks**, where I combine real-world reference data with advanced modeling techniques to create accurate, performance-optimized environments. I capture my own reference data using drone photography and extensive on-site photo documentation when possible, and regularly work with publicly available aerial LiDAR data, digital orthophotos, YouTube reference footage, and client-provided materials. For vehicle projects, I often create photogrammetric reference sets from hundreds of images, if possible, though I can work with much less.

Through 80+ projects exploring different techniques and workflows, I've developed a deep understanding of what works (and what doesn't) across various modeling scenarios. This extensive experience has allowed me to refine efficient workflows and identify the best solutions for each unique project requirement.

I integrate programming skills with traditional 3D modeling, creating custom tools and automated processes that ensure consistency, accuracy, and faster turnaround times. Every project benefits from my deep understanding of both the technical and experiential aspects of racing and flight simulation.

I take on commission work ranging from individual vehicle models to complete track environments. Each collaboration starts with understanding your specific needs and performance requirements.

## My Background
My journey began after I had to pause my karting hobby due to financial constraints. I wanted to recreate my hobby digitally so I could continue practicing and enjoying it, so I began by modeling my home karting track. I have been learning and using Blender since late 2020, along with numerous other free and open-source tools to model any environment or object I need. Since then, I've created streamlined workflows and custom tools, like [Pointgram](https://github.com/ohyeah2389/Pointgram), that enable me to produce highly accurate, detailed models on schedule.

## Skills & Expertise
- **Technical Skills:** Project management, quoting and estimation, time management, resource organization
- **Tools & Technologies:** Blender 4, CloudCompare, QGIS, RealityCapture

## When I'm Not Working
Outside of work, I spend my time simracing, tinkering with electronics and programming projects, studying, learning, and trying to improve my everyday life.
