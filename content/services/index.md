## Introduction

I'm Aaron, a specialized 3D modeler creating high-fidelity racing circuits for consumer- and professional-level simulators. My work emphasizes technical accuracy and attention to detail, demonstrated by my success with projects like my [Club Motorsports track model](../posts/club_motorsports/).

I offer services under two distinct structures designed to meet different project requirements and budget considerations:

**Commissions**

This structure is designed for clients seeking high-quality track models for public release and community use. I handle the complete modeling process while retaining authorship and distribution rights under Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0 licensing. This allows me to offer a competitive hourly rate while ensuring long-term maintenance and updates. You receive a track built to your specifications and desired detail level, with optional project funding credit, while the sim racing community gains access to a professionally modeled circuit.

**Contract Work**

This structure accommodates clients requiring custom licensing terms, proprietary data usage, or performance of specialized tasks. This is ideal for businesses, racing organizations, or projects involving existing assets, providing complete flexibility in intellectual property arrangements, distribution methods, and project scope. The pricing will reflect the full commercial value of the work and the transfer of rights.

## Section 1: Commissions

### Guidelines

**Reference Data Standards**

My commission projects rely on robust reference data to ensure the accuracy and quality standards associated with my releases. This includes recent aerial LiDAR data and high-resolution imagery that allow for precise modeling and verification. Circuits without comprehensive reference data can still be modeled through contract work, where I can adapt my workflow to the available resources.

**Real-World Circuits Only**

These commission projects center on real-world racing facilities where reference data can validate accuracy. Fictional circuits, while providing exciting creative challenges, involve different workflows and extended timelines that align better with the contract work structure.

### Pricing

I charge **$30 USD per hour** for commission work. Project duration can vary significantly based on several key factors:

- **Reference data quality and availability**
- **Desired overall detail and optimization level**
- **Track complexity and surface variations**
- **Number of circuit configurations**
- **Elevation changes and grading structures**
- **Building quantity and architectural complexity**
- **Environmental features and foliage detail level**

Each track project involves multiple phases with varying time requirements. While some phases may be streamlined or omitted based on project scope, here's a typical (but non-exhaustive) breakdown for a standard commission:

- **Data acquisition and processing** - 2-4 hours
- **Surface modeling, materials configuration** - 10-20 hours
- **Building modeling, materials configuration** - 8-16 hours
- **Forestry and shrubbery placement** - 3-12 hours

Based on client requirements and available reference data, projects typically fall within these ranges:

- **8-15 hours:** Streamlined track model featuring accurate surfaces, essential infrastructure, and core visual references
- **15-40 hours:** Balanced detail level focusing on impactful visual and functional elements, improved materials, and strategic environmental detail
- **40-100+ hours:** Comprehensive recreation down to fine details, with full performance/resource optimizations in effect

The final scope is determined collaboratively based on your priorities and budget. Portfolio examples showcasing various detail levels can be found on the [Posts page](../posts/), [Discord server](https://discord.gg/9cv8aeQr6S), and [Overtake page](https://www.overtake.gg/downloads/authors/ohyeah2389.264695/).

### Payment

Commission payments are processed through [PayPal](https://paypal.me/pl4sma2389) exclusively.

**Payment Schedule**

Project payment follows a standard two-phase structure:

1. **Initial payment:** 50% of the estimated total cost, due before work begins
2. **Final payment:** Remaining balance based on actual hours worked, due upon completion

After our initial consultation to determine project scope and reference data availability, I provide a detailed time estimate. The initial payment is calculated as half of this estimate multiplied by the $30/hour commission rate. Final billing reflects actual time invested, with the initial payment credited toward the total.

## Section 2: Contract Work

Contract work covers projects requiring custom terms, proprietary data, or specialized services outside the commission structure. This includes business applications, existing project modifications, fictional circuits, and any work requiring flexible licensing arrangements.

Contract rates are determined based on:

- Project ownership and distribution rights
- Commercial licensing and end-product usage terms
- Technical complexity and specialization level
- Team collaboration requirements
- Project timeline

Commission work offers reduced rates because I retain ownership and distribution rights, treating it as a portfolio-building collaboration. Contract work reflects full commercial pricing for transferred rights and custom project requirements. 

Each contract project needs individual assessment to determine scope, terms, and pricing. Please contact me via a channel listed below to discuss your project's requirements.
